<p class=MsoNormal>There must be exactly 9 categories and each category can
have between 1 and 255 puzzles in it. There must be a total of 1,001 puzzles,
but at the moment the 1,001st puzzle is not accessed by the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to have less than 9 categories or a category
with more than 255 puzzles, the workaround is to give two or more categories
the same name. Categories with the same name will be indistinguishable to the
user.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The puzzle board has four lines. The maximum number of
characters on each line is as follows: 11, 13, 13, <span class=GramE>11</span>.
You need to manually specify where the line breaks should be. It is recommended
that you do not have one or two very long lines. It looks nicer if you split
them up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The maximum number of characters across all puzzles is 30,130,
so unless you’re averaging over 30 characters per puzzle, you won’t approach
the limit.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Permissible characters for the answers are A-Z, apostrophe,
and hyphen. All letters will be capitals.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The category names can be up to 7 characters long and should
only be letters or spaces.</p>
