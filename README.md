# Wheel-of-Fortune-Maker
Create customized puzzles and categories for Wheel of Fortune (NES).
## Motivation
[Wheel of Fortune (NES)](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_(NES)) was released in 1988 and many of the puzzles are unfamiliar to modern players. Wheel of Fortune Maker allows users to replace individual puzzles from the original game or even create an entirely new set of puzzles. One goal of the project is to allow users to create specialty puzzle sets. For example a user can make all of the puzzles about video games and gaming. Manually creating custom puzzle sets by editing the ROM directly or through a series of scripts proved to be cumbersome. Wheel of Fortune Maker automates the process of creating custom puzzles and allows individuals with no knowledge of computer programming to make their own puzzles.
